# Notetaker-App

## Description
I created this application to gain valuable experience on express and rest api creation. During this project I gained experience in modular routing, defining post, get and delete methods. And got my first hands on experience when it comes to back end and front end cross functionality. During this project I encountered alot of errors such as my id being returned as a bufffer item and my variable names not matching resulting in the api endpoint and id variable not matching. I used Postman alot to help me fix these errors and ultimately the experience taught me alot.
